# Kai's Website UI

Welcome to the UI for Kai's website. This is a simple and responsive personal website built with React and Redux. It highlights my background, skills, and projects in a clean and organized layout. I used Redux for basic state management and structured the app with reusable components. The goal was to create a straightforward and functional site thatâ€™s easy to maintain and update.
